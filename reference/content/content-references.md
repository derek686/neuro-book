# Content References

This document defines how NeuroBook content points to other workspace files and content nodes. It replaces the older separate content-reference module.

## Positioning

Content references use normal file paths. Current workspace references do not use `chapter://`, `lorebook://`, `db://` or `vfs://` as canonical targets. If old URI protocols enter workspace reference validation, they should be treated as migration errors, not as compatibility fallback.

Goals:

- Use Markdown-like file paths so humans and agents can read references directly.
- Use the same target rules for body inline links and structured `refs`.
- Content node references point to directories.
- Ordinary file references point to files.
- Validation catches broken paths, old protocols and path escapes.

## Legal Targets

Reference targets are workspace-relative or Markdown-relative paths.

```text
../location/孤儿院/
../../manuscript/第一卷/第一章/
./draft.md
lorebook/location/initial-stage/
```

Rules:

- Content node target points to a directory and keeps a trailing `/`.
- Ordinary file target points to a concrete file name, such as `./draft.md`.
- Relative paths resolve from the current Markdown file directory.
- Workspace-root-like paths resolve from the configured reference base; current project paths are preferred in agent tool calls.
- External URLs stay normal Markdown links and do not enter workspace refs validation.

## Inline References

Inline references are natural mentions inside Markdown body text. Use them for appearance, mention, scene location and ordinary relatedness.

```markdown
她在 [孤儿院](../location/孤儿院/) 门前停下。
这段伏笔会在 [第一章](../../manuscript/第一卷/第一章/) 回收。
补充草稿见 [设定草稿](./draft.md)。
主角在 [荒野祭坛](lorebook/location/initial-stage/) 醒来。
```

The source of truth for inline references is the raw Markdown text. The system may derive `inlineRefs`, but authors and agents should not hand-maintain an `inlineRefs` field.

## Structured Refs

Structured `refs` express explicit stable relationships that the system should understand, such as definitions, constraints, dependencies, parent-child ownership, foreshadowing, payoff, direct causality, conflict or derivation.

```yaml
refs:
  - relation: foreshadows
    target: ../note/主角地球死亡原因/
    note: 该设定仍为 pending。
```

Fields:

- `relation`: free string. Recommended values include `defines`, `constrains`, `depends_on`, `part_of`, `contains`, `foreshadows`, `pays_off`, `conflicts_with`, `derived_from`.
- `target`: workspace path or Markdown-relative path.
- `note`: optional note.

Structured `refs` express relations. They do not express narrative disclosure, role knowledge or information-control permission.

Do not bulk-add all chapter characters, places and mechanisms into structured refs. If the relationship is only "mentioned", "appears in" or "related to", prefer inline Markdown links or omit it.

## Pending And Status

`pending` is not a reference protocol. It is content state.

- `draft`: draft, not stable fact.
- `pending`: unresolved question or unconfirmed setting.
- `active`: confirmed fact, usable by writing and retrieval.
- `archived`: retained history, not default current fact.

Unresolved settings should be content nodes with pending status, or collected under a project-specific pending notes area.

## Validation

`workspace node validate TARGET` should check:

- Relative path resolves inside the workspace.
- Target exists.
- Content node target uses directory path.
- Old protocols `chapter://`, `lorebook://`, `db://`, `vfs://` do not enter workspace reference validation.
- Deprecated status and legacy extension fields do not survive active content.

Old protocols are migration issues. Do not silently rewrite them without user or migration-tool intent.

## Agent Rules

When creating or editing content:

1. Create content nodes with `workspace node new`.
2. Edit `index.md` frontmatter and body.
3. Use relative Markdown links inside prose.
4. Use structured refs only for stable semantic relations.
5. Run `workspace node validate TARGET` after moving or editing references.

Tool paths are not Markdown links. Agent file tools should use cwd-relative project paths such as `{project}/lorebook/character/hero/`.
